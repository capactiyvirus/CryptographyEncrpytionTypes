This project was used to find way to encrypt data using different methods.

MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU USE THIS YOU BECAREFUL TO NOT ENCYPT YOUR OWN FILES!!!!

This works by encrypting all files in folder called "testDir" in the same folder as the python script!

1. so make a folder calling it testDir
2. put what ever you want encrypt into the folder
3. run the code it will encrpyt and decrypt
4. Just make sure you store keys properly!
